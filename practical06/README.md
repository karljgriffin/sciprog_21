This contains the code for practical06:
1. matmult contains the whole matrix multiplication in one script
2. The Step6 folder contains a main script and a mm script, the latter which contains the matrix multiplication function and is called from the main script
3. Makefile is then used to simplify / organise the code for compilation. This is particularly useful if working with massive blocks of code with many different scripts
